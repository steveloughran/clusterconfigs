# This file keeps track of the last known mount-point for each DFS data dir.
# It is safe to delete, since it will get regenerated the next time that the DataNode starts.
# However, it is not advised to delete this file since Ambari may 
# re-create a DFS data dir that used to be mounted on a drive but is now mounted on the root.
# Comments begin with a hash (#) symbol
# data_dir,mount_point
